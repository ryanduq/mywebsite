			Welcome to my page. There is not much to see at the moment. Most of what is here is random and only meant to test some of HTML's and CSS's functionality as well as some application testing(more of that later).
			Currently, I am a student  of CSE at Georgia Tech. My interests are in orbital mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational mathematics. 
			My work is in structural design and construction administration during development. My hobbies are gaming, rock climbing, and fly fishing.
